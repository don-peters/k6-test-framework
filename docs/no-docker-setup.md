# Running K6 Tests Without Docker

## ✅ **You DON'T need Docker to run k6 tests!**

Docker is **only** required for the monitoring stack (Grafana dashboards). The k6 tests work perfectly without it.

## What Works Without Docker

### ✅ **All Test Execution**
```bash
# These all work without Docker:
k6 run tests/samples/basic-test.js
npm run test:sample
npm run test:smoke
npm run test:load
npm run test:stress
npm run test:spike
```

### ✅ **Results & Metrics**
- **Console output**: Real-time metrics displayed in terminal
- **JSON results**: Save detailed results to files
- **Summary reports**: Performance statistics after test completion

### ✅ **Example Commands**
```bash
# Run test with console output
k6 run tests/samples/basic-test.js

# Save results to JSON file
k6 run --out json=results/test-results.json tests/load/api-load-test.js

# Run with custom VUs and duration
k6 run --vus 50 --duration 2m tests/smoke/api-smoke-test.js
```

## What Requires Docker

### ⚠️ **Only for Real-time Dashboards**
Docker is **only** needed for:
- **Grafana dashboards**: Visual charts and graphs
- **InfluxDB**: Time-series database for storing metrics
- **Real-time monitoring**: Live performance visualization

### 📊 **If You Want Dashboards Later**
You can install Docker Desktop later and run:
```bash
npm run monitoring:up
k6 run --out influxdb=http://localhost:8086/k6 tests/load/api-load-test.js
```

## Current Setup Status

✅ **Ready to use immediately:**
- k6 installed and working
- All test files created
- npm scripts configured
- Multiple APIs to test

❌ **Not installed (optional):**
- Docker Desktop
- Grafana monitoring stack

## Quick Start (No Docker)

```bash
# 1. Run a basic test
k6 run tests/samples/basic-test.js

# 2. Test multiple APIs
npm run test:smoke

# 3. Save results to file
k6 run --out json=results/my-test.json tests/api/multi-api-test.js

# 4. View saved results
cat results/my-test.json | jq '.metrics'
```

## Summary

You have a **fully functional k6 testing framework** right now! 
- ✅ Test execution works perfectly
- ✅ All APIs are accessible and tested
- ✅ Results are captured and saved
- ⚠️ Docker is only needed for fancy dashboards (optional)

The framework is **complete and ready for GitHub sharing** without Docker!
